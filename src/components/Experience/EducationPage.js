					<h3>B.S. Computer Science</h3>
					<p>
						I am currently a junior at USC studying Computer
						Science. At school I am involved in two clubs, CAIS++
						and Scope. CAIS++ is a group of students that focus on
						Artificial Integlligence and how it can be used for
						social good. Scope is a club where a group of students
						gather to learn different frameworks, and create
						projects based on the frameworks that they learned. I am
						also a member of the USC club basketball team, and the
						Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
